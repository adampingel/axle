See [Release Notes](/release_notes/) for the record of previously released features.

## 0.5.0 (May 2019)

* Move to Scala 2.12
* Changes in `axle.game` to provide `Generator` where needed, and return a `ConditionalProbabilityTable0`
* Redo `axle.stats`
  * `ProbabilityModel` typeclass (refactored from `Distribution`) including syntactic support
  * Implicitly conjurable `cats.Monad` from a `ProbabilityModel`, which supports for comprehensions via cats syntax support
  * `Variable` instead of `RandomVariable`
  * remove `Bayes`
* `axle.quantumcircuit` package for modelling computing with quantum circuits
* Replace `axle.agebra.Zero` with `spire.algebra.AdditiveMonoid.zero`
* Remove `axle-spark` (Spark "spoke") for now
* Move `axle.ml.distance` to `axle.algebra.distance`
* `axle.dummy` for a handful of scanLeft calls
* Remove Spark impacts on typeclasses in `axle.algebra`. Eg: Spark's `ClassTag` requirement `map` created the difficulty:
  * `Functor`: removed and replaced with `cats.Functor`
  * `Scanner`, `Aggregator`, `Zipper`, `Indexed`, `Talliable`, `Finite`: Refactored as Kind-1 typeclasses
* Vertex and Edge projections for jung graphs
* Fix `axle.joda.TicsSpec` handling of timezones
* Update Monix, Kittens, Cats
* ScaleExp works with negative exponent
* ScalaCheck tests for
  * Group and Module of UnittedQuantity
  * MetricSpace axle.algebra.GeoMetricSpace
* `axle.ml.GeneticAlgorithm` rewritten in terms of [kittens](https://github.com/milessabin/kittens)
* `Show`, `Order`, `Eq` witnesses
  * Eq.fromUniversalEquals where applicable
  * SAM inference elsewhere

* PM.filter's predicate should also be a Region
* get rid of `implicit val prob = ProbabilityModel[ConditionalProbabilityTable]`

* Fix `axle.stats.entropy`
* Fix `axle.game.moveFromRandomState`
* Fix `CPT.probabilityOf` (it's incomplete)
* Laws for `Region` (rename as a "Sigma Algebra"? See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21a85f1YS5Q)
* `Show[Region]` TODOs
* `Show[Factor]` should include `Show[A => Boolean]`
* Axiom for observe: val a = observe(gen) => ProbabilityOf(a) > 0
* Fix third Kolmogorov law
* Review groupBy uses -- they use university equality.  Replace with Eq
* Axiom? pm.filter(X=x).P(X=x) == 1
* Fix stuff like the "a" in monadForProbabilityModel Monad.pure

* "marginalize out" as "sumOut" in `ProbabilityModel` typeclass?
* Iterative game playing algorithm is intractible, but shares intent with sequential monte carlo
* Think about Information Theory's "Omega" vis-a-vis Sequential Monte Carlo
* alias `uniform` as `Bernoulli`

* Eliminate entropy consumption of `rng` side-effect (eg `applyMove(Riffle())`)
  * "Chance" should be its own player
  * Each N bits consumed during `Riffle()` is its own move
  * Chance moves consume `UnittedQuantity[Information, N]`

* QBit2.factor

* KolmogorovProbabilityAxioms for Alarm-Burglary-Earthquake model
  * Requires ProbabilityModel[BayesianNetwork] (using Interaction graph, Elimination graph, Jointree)

* LogisticMap md back to 4k x 4k

* â€¦ (aka "etc") as Stream.from(Int)
* Fix logistic regression and move LogisticRegression.md back
* Is `ConditionalProbabilityTable.variable` necessary?

    * no incoming with path out monotonically decreases
  * possibly provide a version for acyclic graphs

## 0.7.x (Summer 2019)

* P / Case expression DSL (PExpr, PMultiply, ...)
* CaseIs replaced by T => Boolean as the Expression type?
* Prove and generalize forall E : P(E) + P(not E) = 1 (somewhat redundant with 'combination', but this tests that 'not' on expressions works properly)

* Optimize `conditionExpression` implementations
* Optimize `KolmogorovProbabilityAxioms.combination`
