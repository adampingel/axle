See [Release Notes](/release_notes/) for the record of previously released features.

## 0.5.0 (December 2019)

* Move to Scala 2.12
* Changes in `axle.game` to provide `Generator` where needed, and return a `ConditionalProbabilityTable0`
* Redo `axle.stats`
  * `ProbabilityModel` typeclass (refactored from `Distribution`) including syntactic support
  * Implicitly conjurable `cats.Monad` from a `ProbabilityModel`, which supports for comprehensions via cats syntax support
  * `Variable` instead of `RandomVariable`
  * remove `Bayes`
* `axle.quantumcircuit` package for modelling computing with quantum circuits

* Move `axle.ml.distance` to `axle.algebra.distance`
* `axle.dummy` for a handful of scanLeft calls
* Remove Spark impacts on typeclasses in `axle.algebra`. Eg: Spark's `ClassTag` requirement `map` created the difficulty:
  * `Functor`: removed and replaced with `cats.Functor`
  * `Scanner`, `Aggregator`, `Zipper`, `Indexed`, `Talliable`, `Finite`: Refactored as Kind-1 typeclasses
* Vertex and Edge projections for jung graphs

* Update Monix, Kittens, Cats
* ScaleExp works with negative exponent
* ScalaCheck tests for
  * Group and Module of UnittedQuantity
  * MetricSpace axle.algebra.GeoMetricSpace
* `axle.ml.GeneticAlgorithm` rewritten in terms of [kittens](https://github.com/milessabin/kittens)
* `Show`, `Order`, `Eq` witnesses
  * Eq.fromUniversalEquals where applicable
  * SAM inference elsewhere

  * Replace uses with `.show` from `cats.implicits` or show string interpolation
* Remove extraneous `cutoff` argument for `PCA`
* Replace Tut with MDoc
* Lawful ScalaCheck tests for
  * `Module`s in `axle.algebra`
  * `SimilaritySpace`s for `SmithWaterman` & `NeedlemanWunsch`
* Fix Order[Card]

* `ProbabilityModel.filter`'s predicate should be a `Region`
* Replace `CaseIs` with `Region`
* `Show[Factor]` should include `Show[A => Boolean]`
* Is `ProbabilityModel.mapValues` really needed? (maybe we need a map that maps keys and values together, which could be used to implement `redistribute`)
* Is `ConditionalProbabilityTable.variable` necessary?
* `ProbabilityModel.unit` shouldn't take a `Variable`?

* LogisticMap md back to 4k x 4k
* Release and publish site

* alias `uniform` as `Bernoulli`

* Demo Mandelbrot with Rational
* Friend of Spire
* Get rid of implicit arg passing to KMeans in ClusterIrises.md (and KMeansSpecification)
* Review groupBy uses -- they use university equality.  Replace with Eq
* Fix logistic regression and move LogisticRegression.md back

## 0.5.2 (April 2020)

* KolmogorovProbabilityAxioms for Alarm-Burglary-Earthquake model
  * Requires ProbabilityModel[BayesianNetwork] (using Interaction graph, Elimination graph, Jointree)
* Actually provide random `Region` (vs just a `RegionEq`) to all `KolmogorovProbabilityProperties`
* Laws for `Region` ("Sigma Algebra"? [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21a85f1YS5Q))

* `similarity` syntax for `SimilaritySpace` (see `axle.bio.*`)
* Tests for `axle.ast`
* Kind projector for projections of jung graphs for Finite
* Functors for jung should use projections (study cats disjunction, scala Either)
* kittens 1.0.0-RC3 or magnolia
  * pattern match in FirstOrderPredicateLogic
  * subtyping for Suit and Rank
* Machinist?
* replace some refs to {CPT0,TallyDist0} with ProbabilityModel
* Tics should take an argument
* Factor tics and tics-{joda,algebra,spire} into separate libs
* Update Spire (to match cats version)
* Most MapRedicible witnesses are inefficient (eg calling toVector, toSeq, etc)
* remove unnecessary implicit Field, R{,i}ng, {Additive, Multiplicative}Monoid once spire/cats play well
