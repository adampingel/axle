See [Release Notes](/release_notes/) for the record of previously released features.

## 0.5.0 (April 2019)

* Move to Scala 2.12
* Changes in `axle.game` to provide `Generator` where needed, and return a `ConditionalProbabilityTable0`
* Redo `axle.stats`
  * `ProbabilityModel` typeclass (refactored from `Distribution`)
  * Implicitly conjurable `cats.Monad` from a `ProbabilityModel`, which supports for comprehensions via cats syntax support
  * `Variable` instead of `RandomVariable`
  * remove `Bayes`
* Replace `axle.agebra.Zero` with `spire.algebra.AdditiveMonoid.zero`
* Remove `axle-spark` (Spark "spoke") for now
* Move `axle.ml.distance` to `axle.algebra.distance`
* `axle.dummy` for a handful of scanLeft calls
* Remove Spark impacts on typeclasses in `axle.algebra`. Eg: Spark's `ClassTag` requirement `map` created the difficulty:
  * Functor: removed and replaced with `cats.Functor`
  * Scanner, Aggregator, Zipper, Indexed, Talliable, Finite: Refactored as Kind-1 typeclasses
* Vertex and Edge projections for jung graphs
* Fix axle.joda.TicsSpec handling of timezones
* Update Monix, Kittens, Cats
* ScaleExp works with negative exponent
* ScalaCheck tests for
  * Group and Module of UnittedQuantity
  * MetricSpace axle.algebra.GeoMetricSpace
* `axle.ml.GeneticAlgorithm` rewritten in terms of [kittens](https://github.com/milessabin/kittens)
* `Show`, `Order`, `Eq` witnesses
  * Eq.fromUniversalEquals where applicable
  * SAM inference elsewhere
* Remove `axle.string` and `axle.show`.
  * Replace uses with `.show` from `cats.implicits` or show string interpolation
* Remove extraneous `cutoff` argument for `PCA`
* Replace Tut with MDoc
* Lawful ScalaCheck tests for
  * `Module`s in `axle.algebra`
  * `SimilaritySpace`s for `SmithWaterman` & `NeedlemanWunsch`

* `similarity` syntax for SimilaritySpace (see axle.bio.*)

* Implement {TD,CPT}.{poe, ce}
* Fix Statistics.md
* Fix TwoDice.md
* ProbabilityModel.conditionExpression should enforce that `predicate` tests subset of `A` that does not appear in `B` of `screen` function

* KolmogorovProbabilityAxioms.combination
* "Combination" generalizes to event sets (where antecedent is rephrased as "A intersect B == emptyset")
  but the default distribution of antecedents would usually be uninteresting (evaluate to false)

* KolmogorovProbabilityAxioms for Monty Hall (for some fixed P(switch))
* Stop specifying ConditionalProbabilityTable0 in axle.game package object methods

* KolmogorovProbabilityAxioms for Alarm-Burglary-Earthquake model
* ProbabilityModel[BayesianNetwork] (using Interaction graph, Elimination graph, Jointree)

* Kind projector instead of `type F[T] = ConditionalProbabilityTable0[T, Rational]` and `CPTR[T]` ?
* Kind projector instead of type lambdas

* CaseIs replaced by T => Boolean as the Expression type?
* Prove and generalize CaseIs(heads) is equal to "not tails"
* P / Case expression DSL
* What to do with TD1 and CPT2? Fix "cpt" in InformationTheorySpec
* ProbabilityModel.probabilityOfNot ProbabilityModel.conditionNot

* Rename TallyDistribution0 to Tally (Or is this really just a Map?)
* Rename and ConditionalProbabilityTable0 to ProbabilityTable0
* Heterogenous Model types

* Move KolmogorovProbabilityAxioms to `axle.stats.laws`
* ScalaCheck Monad[ProbabilityModel] (needs missing tailRecM mehod)
* Move NaiveBayesClassifier.md back
* Fix NaiveBayesSpec (and .md)
* Finish NaiveBayesClassifier
* Fix GeneticAlgorithms.md (as much as possible, then move out of the way)
* Move GeneticAlgorthms.md back
* Fix GeneticAlgorithmSpec

* Fix markdown lint warnings
* LogisticMap back to 4k x 4k
* configure makeSite to preview: previewFixedPort := Some(9999)
* copy css using makeSite (not update-docs.sh)
* publish site using [sbt-site](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-site/publishing.html) and sbt-s3
* figure out better way to reference images
* Publish site

## 0.6.x (Spring 2019)

* Qubit, Hadamard, CNot, etc (quantum "is constant" circuit)
* Cats effect/io, FS2, or similar for all `png`, `html`, data fetches, and all `fext scala | xargs egrep -e 'scala.io|java.io' | grep -v 'should be'`
* Fix logistic regression and move LogisticRegression.md back
* Tests for axle.ast
* Demo Mandelbrot with Rational
* Friend of Spire
* Get rid of implicit arg passing to KMeans in ClusterIrises.md (and KMeansSpecification)
* Kind projector for projections of jung graphs for Finite
* Functors for jung should use projections (study cats disjunction, scala Either)
* kittens 1.0.0-RC3 or magnolia
  * pattern match in FirstOrderPredicateLogic
  * subtyping for Suit and Rank

## 0.7.x (Summer 2019)

## 0.8.x (Fall 2020)

* Replace with Cats: FoldLeft, Bijection, FunctionPair, Endofunctor
* Sort out MapFrom, FromStream, FromSet
* Most MapRedicible witnesses are inefficient (eg calling toVector, toSeq, etc)
* remove unnecessary implicit Field, R{,i}ng, {Additive, Multiplicative}Monoid once spire/cats play well

* game theory axioms
* axle.game: Observable[T]
* move state dist stream
* redo original monty hall spec
* Max bet for Poker
* Game.strategyFor should return a M[underscore] type upon which the ProbabilityModel[M, Rational] can act
* Type-level matrix dimension using `-Yliteral-types` and `singleton-ops` in `LinearAlgebra` typeclass
* Make the `Int` abstract in KMeans{,Visualization}, LinearAlgebra, etc
* Featurizing functions should return HLists or other typelevel sequences in order to avoid being told # features
